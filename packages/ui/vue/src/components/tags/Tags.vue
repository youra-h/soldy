			`dataset` next to `aria`: the overflow mode goes to the theme through
			`data-overflow`, and the row's layout (wrapping, scrolling) is all its
			business.

			The `default` slot gets the shown tags (`shown`): markup of one's own
			lays them out as it needs — in a strip, in a row with a tail in a panel.
			Each tag is drawn there exactly once, as here: a second drawing would
			overwrite its record in the bundles' registry.

			<!--
				The items' slots are static and get the item through the scope —
				dynamic names resolve only in Vue (see ListBox/Tabs). The relay is
				whole: each tag slot has its `item-<slot>`, whose scope is the tag
				slot's scope plus the tag. The tag draws its close icon itself while
				the slot is not given — so the icon's slot goes to it only when the set
				has it.

				`shown`, not `items`: what the filter left. A hidden item unmounts but
				stays in the collection — the data own the composition, not the markup
				(`owned` in `TCollectionExtension`). Dropping the filter brings it back.

				The slots are relayed only when the set has any of them: the relay
				refers to the loop's `item`, and Vue redraws an item with such slots on
				every redraw of its owner (AGENTS.md, Pitfalls).
