				The field is a ready `Input`, not an `<input>` of its own: it has the
				`leading`/`trailing` slots for icons, and the styles. The whole ARIA
				set of the combobox (`role="combobox"`, `aria-expanded`,
				`aria-controls`, `aria-activedescendant`, `aria-autocomplete`) lives
				in `field.aria` (`TSelect`, `TSelectExtension`,
				`TSelectKeyboardPlugin`), and `Input.vue` puts it on its inner
				`<input>` itself.

				`:ctrl="field"`, not a set of props: the text, the placeholder and the
				combobox ARIA belong to the separate `TInput` instance (`field`) that
				Select owns (`TSelect.field`, `TSelectExtension`). No `:value` or
				`:placeholder` next to it — they would be second copies. `disabled`,
				`size`, `variant`, `readonly`, `required`, `name`, `clearable` and
				the error (`invalid`) are carried by the instance too: Select keeps them
				in sync itself. The clear button gets its name from the field's names
				plugin. `id` is a prop of `TIdPlugin`, not of the core: Select hands
				its own `id` (the app's or the form field's) to the field, and `Input`
				puts it on its `<input>`.

				Select's own `aria` set — the name (`aria_label`, `aria_labelledBy`),
				the description, `aria-invalid` — goes as attributes to `Input`, which
				hands them to its `<input>` over the combobox set: the name and the
				description belong to the focused element. The consumer's attributes go
				over both.

				The field draws the clear button — first in its end slot, before the
				arrow. Its `clear` command clears the field, and `TSelectExtension`
				drops the choice by its event: there is no button here.

				The nested `Input`'s `readonly` is Select's, driven by `editable`.
				Select-only (`editable: false`, the default) keeps the field readonly;
				`editable: true` lifts it and lets the user type. What typing does is
				`editableMode`'s, decided whole in `TEditablePlugin`: the markup knows
				nothing of highlighting and filtering, so all adapters behave the same.

				`readonly` turns off the native `required` of the nested `<input>`
				(the browser does not validate a readonly field), so `TInput` sets
				`aria-required` in `field.aria` explicitly — otherwise the screen
				reader would not hear the state (`TInput._syncInputAccessibility()`).

			The panel is teleported, so it lies outside the field's subtree. Two
			consequences: its anchor is Select's root, and `dismiss_ownerAttribute`
			marks Select as its owner — otherwise a press inside the panel would count
			as a press outside and close it.

			Openness is `visible` (v-show), not `rendered` (v-if), and it matters:
			the options join the collection on mounting and leave it on unmounting.
			Hidden by `v-if`, the panel would empty the collection on closing, and
			the choice with it — the field's value. `v-show` sets `display: none`,
			which also takes the panel out of the accessibility tree.

			The template does not compute the panel's side: the core turns Select's
			`placement` into `panelPlacement` and `panelFlip`, and at the window's
			edge `TAnchorPlugin` picks the side, unless `placement` forbade the flip.

			`panelDataset` — the panel's `data-*` from Select: "being pulled"
			(`data-swiping`), by which the theme drops the transition while the panel
			follows the finger. Openness (`data-open`) Frame writes itself — it is
			its layer's visibility — and the side after a flip (`data-placement`) the
			anchor plugin. The gesture plugin writes the offset during the gesture
			(`--so-swipe-offset`) into the panel itself.

				stands at the edge on the field's side (`data-placement`), placed by the
				theme. A direct child of the panel and outside the list: in
				`[role=listbox]` the screen reader would take it for an option, and the
				gesture plugin knows the bar only at the panel itself. Closing without

						The options' slots are static and get the item through the scope —
						dynamic names resolve only in Vue (see Tabs.vue). The relay is whole:
						each option slot has its `item-<slot>`, whose scope is the option
						slot's scope plus the option. The option draws its mark itself while
						its slot is not given — so the mark's slot goes to it only when Select
						has it.

						The options are what the collection draws, by the grouping's sections
						(`drawnSections`), as in ListBox: a group with a label — in
						`SelectGroup`, options without a group — right in the list, and
						between neighboring sections, while Select asks for it
						(`groupSeparators`), a mute separator (`aria-hidden`, not
						`separator`: ARIA lets only options and groups into a `listbox`). The
						sections follow the shown order — the arrows highlight the options as
						they stand on screen. Without groups there is one section — no wrapper,
						no separator. A filter that removed all options of a group removes its
						section with the label.

						A section has its entries in order, keyed by the entry's key. Without
						a window these are all its shown options — what the filter left. A
						hidden option unmounts but stays in the collection — the data own the
						composition, not the markup (`owned` in `TCollectionExtension`).
						Dropping the filter brings it back with its choice.

						In the window of the `Virtual` wrapper (a list without groups) — the
						visible options and fillers in place of the skipped ones: a `div`
						under `aria-hidden` whose height the theme takes from its style. One
						loop for options and fillers, as in ListBox: loops by blocks would
						remount an option moving from block to block. The relay is written
						for the options of a group and for those without one: their wrappers
						differ.

						The slots are relayed only when Select has any of them: the relay
						refers to the loop's `entry`, and Vue redraws an item with such
						slots on every redraw of its owner (AGENTS.md, Pitfalls) — every
						option on every opening of the panel.
					-->
					<!--
						Options from data are mounted from the panel's first opening on
						(`contentRendered`): a closed Select nobody opened builds its
						field and an empty list. Closing hides the panel and keeps them.
						The slot itself is not conditional: options in markup enter the
						collection only mounted, and without them the closed field would
						lose the selected text and the value.
