/**
 * useAdapter — binds an adapter context to Solid, the counterpart of Vue's
 * `useAdapter`.
 *
 * - state is shallow, a signal per property read (`createShallowState`),
 *   filled by the subscription to the binding;
 * - inputs: an effect over all props, the binding writes the changed ones;
 * - the component body runs once, on the server too: that is the acceptance
 *   (`attach()`), and the cleanup is `onCleanup`;
 * - events go to the `onXxx` callback props, after the acceptance, until
 *   `detach`.
 *
 * The adapter's `ref` binds the root to `TElementPlugin` and hands the same
 * node to the consumer's `ref`. A collection has two contexts: the facade is
 * bound by `useCollectionAdapter`, before the component, and `joinBindings`
 * joins it with the component's binding. AGENTS.md (Solid), «Связка».
