/**
 * The values of the look of the oren theme — exactly those it has CSS for.
 *
 * The library declares no `variant`, `view`, `shape` or `animation` values of
 * its own: its registries are empty, and the theme augments them here (root
 * `AGENTS.md`, «Оформление: значения объявляет тема»). Once this file is in
 * the program, the props of the components take these names, and the compiler
 * rejects a typo.
 *
 * It comes into the program by either of two ways: with the stylesheet
 * imported from a module of TS — `import '@soldy-ui/theme-oren'` — or with the
 * behavior, `@soldy-ui/theme-oren/setup`, whose declarations reference this
 * file. The second works in any build: Angular CLI takes the stylesheet from
 * `styles` in `angular.json` and Nuxt from `css` in `nuxt.config.ts`, and
 * there no module of TS imports it.
 *
 * A value that is the look of the block without a modifier (`normal`, `filled`
 * of Button, `outlined` of CheckBox, `line`, `dot`, `rounded`, `pulse`) may
 * have no rule of its own in the CSS, but it is declared all the same: it can
 * be set explicitly, and `normal` of ProgressLinear, ProgressSpinner and Rating
 * is not the base but the neutral.
