/**
 * The stylesheets of components: an entry per component of the export,
 * `@soldy-ui/theme-oren/<component>.css`, next to the whole sheet
 * (`AGENTS.md` of the package, «Слои: лист целиком и по компонентам»).
 *
 * An entry imports the shared part (`dist/common.css`) and the parts of its
 * component (`dist/parts/<part>.css`), its own and the inner ones: Select
 * draws its field with Input, its tags with Tags, its rows with Button, its
 * panel at the field — so its entry carries `input`, `tags`, `button`,
 * `anchored`, `swipe`, `place`. A part is a file the build cuts out of the
 * whole sheet by its cascade layers: the layer of the shared layer of themes
 * (`base.so.<part>`) and the layers of the theme (`components.so.<part>`,
 * `components.so.modifiers.<part>`). The bundler of an application puts a file
 * once however many entries import it, and the order of the layers is declared
 * by the shared part before any rule — so it does not depend on the order of
 * the imports.
 *
 * The composition is knowledge of the templates of the library, so it is
 * checked against the markup: every node a component draws on the Vue
 * playground, with all of its parts, is covered by its entry
 * (`packages/playground/vue/__tests__/theme-entries.spec.ts`), and every
 * variable a part reads is declared by its entry (`__tests__/entries.spec.ts`).
 */

/**
 * The parts of the shared layer of themes that go into the shared part of
 * every entry, not into files of their own: the reset of the library's nodes,
 * the writing-direction sign, the fading of a disabled part and the scales any
 * part reads — the caption, the marker of a required field, the tap zone of a
 * small button. The shared part also carries every default of the document
 * root of the other parts — the scales of blocks (`--so-button-height-sm`):
 * the neighbours stand by them, the cell of Pagination by the height of
 * Button, — the tokens and the schemes of the theme, and what Tailwind puts out
 * for the whole sheet.
