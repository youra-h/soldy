/**
 * TItemGroupExtension — a group part enters the collection's grouping: the key to the items inside, the label to the grouping.
 *
 * A markup group (`Menu.Group`, `Menu.RadioGroup`, `ListBox.Group`,
 * `Select.Group`) goes the same channel as the `_.group` mark in data: it
 * lowers its key along with its collection's engine down the elevator
 * (`ITEM_GROUP_ELEVATOR`), and an item inside puts the key into its marks
 * when it joins the collection (`TCollectionItemExtension`). There is no
 * second membership storage — `meta` remembers the key, as the mark from
 * data.
 *
 * The key comes from the group's instance (`uid`): the consumer has no reason
 * to address a markup group by key, and there is no prop for it. The key does
 * not go into the document, so the server and the browser do not compare it.
 *
 * The group registers its label in the grouping (`register`): the sections
 * get it when `groups` has no label. The registration is separate from
 * `groups` — resetting the prop does not erase the markup group's — and sets
 * no order. The label changed — the group registers the new one over the old.
 *
 * Phases — as the field link's (`TFieldControlExtension`):
 *
 * - **assembly** — the link for the items: they read it at their assembly;
 * - **entry** — the label's registration and the subscription to its change.
 *   The grouping is someone else's storage, and the framework may throw an
 *   assembled group away without accepting it. The entry is the context's
 *   `attach` or the entry of the group's first item (`enter` of the link),
 *   whichever comes first: React accepts the children before their parent,
 *   and the items joined a group without its label — the sections came
 *   unlabelled first (benchmarks/parity/README.md). An accepted item has an
 *   accepted group above it, so the early entry registers no thrown-away
 *   group;
 * - **removal** (the context's `destroy`) — the unsubscription and the
 *   registration removed.
 *
 * No collection above or it has no grouping — the group lowers an empty
 * link: the items need no key, and a group link from above does not reach
 * them. A group the owner draws for a section from data is the same part: no
 * item has its key — an item from data takes no group key — and the
 * registration does not change the sections.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   adapter.use(TItemGroupExtension, { elevator: VueElevatorFactory })
