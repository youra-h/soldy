/**
 * TTabsContentBindingExtension — binds a panel to its tab.
 *
 * The panel does not register in the collection: it is not in `items`. It
 * finds the existing tab with the same `value` and takes that tab's item
 * context (`TItemContext`) of its own, for the mount: the same adapters as
 * `TTabsItemCollectionFacade` has, but the panel releases them itself — on
 * rebinding and on teardown. A context shared with the tab and released by
 * one of them would break the other. A panel without a tab has no context at
 * all, or its `active` would answer for the previous tab. The facade reports
 * the change of activity that comes with the context; the binding only swaps
 * it.
 *
 * The panel's side of the tab link — `id` and `aria-labelledby` — is written
 * here into the panel's `aria`: this is the only place that knows the panel
 * found its tab. The panel has no `id` formula of its own: the tab
 * (`TTabsItemIdsPlugin`) wrote the panel's `id` into its `aria-controls`, and
 * the panel takes exactly that, so the two halves cannot diverge. When the tab
 * remounts or its `TIdPlugin` changes, its ids change (`change:aria`) and the
 * panel follows.
 *
 * An `id` the application gave the panel (its `TIdPlugin`) wins over the
 * formula: it goes on the panel from the first render, tab or no tab, and the
 * tab's `aria-controls` points to it. Only the tab's plugin writes
 * `aria-controls`, so an accepted panel hands it its `TIdPlugin`
 * (`bindPanel`) and takes it back on unbinding and teardown (`unbindPanel`).
 * The plugin of the tab's current mount is found in the collection's bundle
 * registry (`COLLECTION_BUNDLES_ELEVATOR`). A tab's bundle enters the registry
 * on the tab's entry — sometimes after the panel, and again on a remount — so
 * the panel hands its `id` over on every registration (`bundle:registered`)
 * too.
 *
 * The tab is looked up only in a Tabs engine (one with `TTabsExtension`). The
 * lift gives the nearest collection's engine, and it may be foreign: a panel
 * outside its tabs under an app-wide `<Toasts>`. A foreign collection is
 * treated as absent, as for `TCollectionItemExtension`: otherwise the panel
 * would bind to a foreign item with a matching `value` — silently under
 * RadioGroup, with a failing assembly where there is no activation.
 *
 * The work follows the context's phases, as in `TCollectionItemExtension`:
 *
 * - **assembly** — the first binding, writing only the panel's own: its
 *   facade and its `aria`. A data tab is already in the collection and the tab
 *   list renders before the panels, so the panel is bound from the first
 *   render, the server's included;
 * - **entry** (`attach`) — binding again, the tab's side, and the
 *   subscriptions: the engine's `item:added`, the registry's
 *   `bundle:registered`, the panel's `change:value`, its `TIdPlugin`'s
 *   `change:id` and the bound tab's `change:aria`. Markup tabs enter on their
 *   own `attach`, and a panel after them finds them on this second lookup.
 *   Subscriptions and the write to the tab wait for entry because those buses
 *   and the tab are not the panel's: React assembles on render, and a
 *   discarded render would leave an extra subscriber on them and the `id` of
 *   a panel that does not exist on the tab. A tab found on assembly is reread
 *   after subscribing, so what it wrote in between (React: the tab's `id` set
 *   by an effect) reaches the panel. From entry to teardown the panel is a
 *   member of the collection (`TCollectionMembers`), as an item is: the
 *   owner's `detach` detaches its own context and the facade's, and the panel
 *   does not hear the tabs go;
 * - **teardown** (`destroy`) — unsubscribing, the panel's attributes, its `id`
 *   at the tab and the tab's context. A context assembled but never accepted
 *   is torn down too: it has no subscriptions, but what assembly took goes.
