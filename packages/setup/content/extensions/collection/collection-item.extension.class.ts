/**
 * TCollectionItemExtension — an item of a collection: its assembly on mount
 * and its entry into the collection.
 *
 * The work follows the context's phases; when each comes is the adapter
 * runtime's call:
 *
 * - **assembly** (constructor) — through the lift: the own collection's
 *   engine, its registrar and the markup group above the item; the item
 *   context goes into the facade, `meta` is taken from the props. Nothing is
 *   written into the owner's storage. The context releases the assembly props
 *   on `connect()`, so the extension is installed right after the context is
 *   created;
 * - **entry** (`attach`) — registration in the owner's collection and
 *   `meta.apply`. This writes into someone else's storage, so it waits until
 *   the framework accepts the component: React assembles on render, and a
 *   discarded render would leave a phantom in the engine, while an item added
 *   after the mount would update its owner in the middle of a child's render.
 *   From entry to teardown the item's own context (`adapter`, its instance is
 *   the item) and the facade's are members of the collection
 *   (`TCollectionMembers`): when the whole
 *   collection comes down, the owner's `detach` detaches them, and an item
 *   does not hear its siblings leave;
 * - **teardown** (`destroy`) — leaving the collection and releasing the item
 *   context.
 *
 * The own collection is the nearest one above, if the item is of it. The lift
 * gives the nearest engine, and it may be foreign: a tag outside Tags under an
 * app-wide `<Toasts>`, a tag or a radio in a Tabs panel. Whose an item is, the
 * engine's factory knows (`factoryOf(...).isSource`): anything else it turns
 * into an item of its own class — a radio entering Tabs became a tab — and the
 * facade, lacking its own collection's extensions, failed to assemble. A
 * foreign collection is treated as absent: no item context, no entry, no
 * `meta`, the item renders on its own. There is no warning: under `<Toasts>`
 * almost any single item stands under a foreign collection, legitimately.
 *
 * The item context (`TItemContext`) belongs to this mount. Its item adapters
 * subscribe to the engine's extensions, and the engine outlives the mount: a
 * data item hidden by a filter or a page stays in the collection and mounts
 * again, React reassembles without unmounting (StrictMode, `<Activity>`). So
 * teardown releases the context, or every show would leave subscribers on the
 * engine, and clears the facade, since React rereads the state of a destroyed
 * assembly and the facade would recreate the adapters. One context per item
 * for all mounts would not do: a tab and its panel take the same item's
 * context, and one releasing it would break the other.
 *
 * An item removed from the collection while mounted destroys its context
 * (`TItemContext.destroy`). A markup item leaving on teardown is not a
 * removal: `rendered` of an external `ctrl` stays as it is, and mounted again
 * the item renders.
 *
 * An item inside a markup group (`Menu.Group`, `ListBox.Group` and the like)
 * joins that group: the key lowered by `TItemGroupExtension` goes into the
 * item's `meta` as `group`, the channel `_.group` takes in data. Only an item
 * the entry adds to the list takes the key — a data item keeps the group of
 * its data, even when the owner renders it inside a section — and only from
 * its own collection: submenu items inside a menu group are the submenu's.
