/**
 * TCollectionExtension — the single entry point that sets up a collection. The
 * facade owns the `engine`.
 *
 * It binds the engine to the bundle registry and lowers to the children,
 * through the lift: the engine (`ITEM_CONTEXT_ELEVATOR`), the item registrar
 * (`COLLECTION_ENGINE_ELEVATOR`), the bundle registry
 * (`COLLECTION_BUNDLES_ELEVATOR`) and the members (`COLLECTION_MEMBERS_ELEVATOR`).
 *
 * The registry is for children that do not enter the collection but are tied
 * to its items: a `Tabs.Content` panel hands its `id` to its tab's link plugin
 * and finds the bundle of the tab's current mount in the registry. The
 * members are detached by the owner's `detach` (`TCollectionMembers`).
